        <h2>Why Vinyl?</h2>
        <p>Vinyl records represent more than just a medium for music—they embody a ritual, an experience, and a connection to the art of listening. The act of selecting a record, placing it on the turntable, and watching it spin creates a mindful moment in our fast-paced digital world.</p>
        <p>While digital music offers convenience, vinyl offers intention. Vinyl Player brings that intentional listening experience to everyone, anywhere, without the need for expensive equipment or physical space for a record collection.</p>
